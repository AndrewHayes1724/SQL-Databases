# Overview

This software essentially allows you to create a database to keep track of the vehicles in your garage. So if you have a lot of cars, you can figure out 
what vehicles have what attributes etc.

The reason I wrote this is because I thought it would be fun and also I saw some practical applications. If you had inventory of anything that you were
looking to sell for example, you could use this program as a sort of inventory system to know what products you had of a certain brand or condition etc.

# Relational Database

The relational database here is SQLite with Python 3.9.7

The structure of database is just a simple table with 5 columns to sort your cars out. But this will be made dynamic in the future

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to create this project

I used Python 3.9.7 and sqlite and the libraries associated with it of course.

# Useful Websites

* [python.org/sqlite3](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sqlite3.html)
* [Tutorials Point/sqlite python](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm)

# Future Work

* Im going to add more sorting features as well as making the table and database creating more dynamic so that it can all be maintained on the front end for anyone to use easily.
* Making each function more robust with more compatibility and dynamic use of the functions, id not needing specific responses but being able to work with whatever is given.
